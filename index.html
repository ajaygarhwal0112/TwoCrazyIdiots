    <h3>Diksha Bagria</h3>
    <p>Not so simple girl with a dream of being a fashion designer and proving her mother right. She is not what I
      always wanted but she is what I always needed. She looks so beautiful when she smiles, it feels like everything is
      so good and everything is just so perfect in my life. She is a little tough to handle but she is the best one too.
      A Little "Ajay" from her makes all my tension fade away. She is very passionate too about her aim in life.

    <h2>Awkward to Lovers</h2>
    <div class="first-para-story">
      <p>We saw each other for first on April 6, when Diksha Joined St. John's international School. I saw her playing
        in the ground and I was sitting in my class, attending chemistry lecture. She wore Lime top that day and I
        remember that dress till this day. We never really talked but one of her classmate said her "Tere liye offer
        aaya h +2 se". We saw each other again after lockdown was over. It was departure time when I was going and she
        came out of her class with her friend, I said "Hi Diksha", her friend replied "Jaate time konsa hii hota h" and
        she gave a little laugh. We always felt awkward around each other as everyone used to tease us with each other's
        name. Once she performed a ramp walk in Dreamer Factory and I didn't see that, instead I just kept my head down
        because I knew if I saw her, everyone will tease us way more. She noticed that I didn't even saw her ramp walk.
        She got very upset after that. And then one random day we talked for more than an hour and she said "I really
        like your personality", and I replied I don't have a crush on you which was actually a lie. And then the second
        day I decided to tell her the truth and whatever I feel about her. We sat down and I told her how much I think
        of her and she just kept looking at me. Next day , I was sitting on the floor and she was sitting on the chair,
        We made eye contact for about a minute , where we kept smiling and looking at each other. Our teacher noticed us
        and then we got scolded. On 3rd of September I finally decided to talk to her again and I said "I am in love
        with you". After that I got busy with teacher's day celebration and other works. On 8th of September she asked
        me to make her presentation and sat beside me. She said "Aaj se m teri gf hu ab kaam kr".

    <div class="second-para-story">
      <p>We started to talk a lot and know about each other. We slowly fell a lot in love with each other. Soon some
        issue occured and I was asked to choose between Diksha or my work. I decided to stay with Diksha and be the
        reason of her smile. We decided to meet for the first time in person. We hugged for the first time and I kissed
        her on the forehead, she cried a little. After that she asked me for a hug as her birthday gift and How could I
        say no. We spent a good time together. From being so awkward to being each other's first kiss and spending every
        moment with each other. I am so lucky to have her in my life. I will always be thankful to god for making her
        mine. There's no more awkwardness, now it's all about making eye contacts from one corner of school to the other
        corner. Love you. </p>
